## Predict 2021

Earlier in the week, my friend Jude and I were talking about 2021 and what was to come. So much about 2020 was 'unprecedented', surely 2021 would be more predictable?

We joked about setting up a facebook thread on new years eve where friends could leave their predictions for 2021 and then, when it pops up as a memory one year later, we can look back on it and have a laugh about whose predictions were the most accurate.

But then I thought, why give that to Facebook? Why not put some of my new software skills to practice and make my own webpage?

So, here it is - My very first webpage! Yes, it is super simple and the design could use some work but I'm only at the start of my web development journey. I've learned quite a lot about Ruby on Rails, the MVC model and bootstrap. And, it'll be nice to look back at this at the end of the year and see how far I've come.

Each commit message explains the steps I took when building this website and hopefully it'll be useful if you'd like to follow along and create your own. These are some of the resources I found really helpful:
- The [Odin Project Intro](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/your-first-rails-application-ruby-on-rails) has a great intro' to rails. My repo is [here](https://github.com/TamMelPer/my_first_rails_app)
- [This](https://github.com/CodeZeus-dev/framework-tutorials) great fundamentals cheatsheet put together by my friend Constantine. 
- [This article](https://hackernoon.com/understanding-your-rails-application-structure-r8w32xj) helped me understand the MVC. 
- A fun [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Fbujmgo60&t=5719s) to build a food log.
- The 'Learn Ruby on Rails' course in Codecademy. 

I will now be attempting to deploy to Heroku.
